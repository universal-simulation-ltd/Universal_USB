import { createThemeStore, type ThemePref } from '@unisim/sdk'

// The light/dark/system preference. The store itself lives in @unisim/sdk
// (createThemeStore, since 0.140.0) — this file only names the key. It opens
// LIGHT and stays light until the user chooses otherwise (the suite rule).
//
// Since SDK 0.143 the key holds this app's OVERRIDE, set from App preferences.
// Absent, the app follows Global preferences (`universal:color-scheme`, itself
// light until chosen). A value saved before 0.143 simply reads as an override.
//
// ⚠️ The key is every user's saved choice. Renaming it silently puts them all
// back on following global. It is also written down a second time, in the pre-paint script in
// `index.html` — `scripts/theme.test.mjs` fails if the two ever drift.
